## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.


### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project.
  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
  
  ## NEW
  KrazyKewlDefi is intended to serve as an NFT e-commerace site,a Yield farm with its own built in Swap feature which can be integrated with Polkadot.
  I also plan on adding a high risk crypto investor that will be built on trust. I have deployed a stake/mining contracts to the Tron network but to no 
  success as I beleive to many scams have happened on Tron and people now invest on Numbers and popularity.

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

## NEW
The solid idea is in place and implemented on the Tron Network.Actually it is being built and added to daily. I am unsatisfied with the Tron network and see this
as the perfect opportunity to make the change.I lost alot on Tron and have the experiance to change chains and am in a hurry to do so.In the extreme end my site will host man types of blockchains and projects with the focus of one project and chain at a time. The final state will be a fully operational defi project.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

## Mockups,specifications etc

A full uncomplete mockup can be found here:(A tron version)
I am using ReactJs for builds and frontend and MetaMask/Web3 to interact with the accounts.In the above page I use TronLink and TronWeb to interact with tron accounts.I have been using Firebase hosting to host my sites as well as their db when I built a telegram bot.

### Ecosystem Fit 
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

## New

All projects in reality are the same when it comes to crypto,lol, but yes, so far mine appears to be unique and different.The name alone is catching and the images are yet to be decided.

## Team :busts_in_silhouette:

Just myself,I am a stay at home self taught coder.

### Team members
* Name of team leader
* Names of team members	
Bruce Powell
### Team Website	
* https://<your_domain>

### Legal Structure 
Please provide the name and registered address of the legal entity executing the project.

A new address will be made with other hosting options pending Grant

### Team's experience
Please describe the team's relevant experience.  If the project involves development work, then we'd appreciated if you can single out a few interesting code commits made by team members on their past projects. For research-related grants, references to past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful. 

10 years experiance as a Software Engineer

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project

3 months

* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) 
FTE

* **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment in BTC for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $30k at the time of submission.

Oct.26/2020-btc=13 000 rounded
1 BTC should cover the costs of providing liquidity to the Swap/liquidity section and any other software hardware upgrades needed to run a full node

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 0.75 BTC

Milestone 1
Implement Substrate Modules into the build I have now and redesign
Fund the contract wallets
Duration:1 month
FTE-1
Costs:0.50 BTC

Everything specified below will be done in Milestone 1 and into Milestone 2

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  
| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features
Finish up the leftovers from Milestone 1 and begin heavy testing.Start the medium articles and tutorials and Introduce KrazyKewlDefi to the Marketing phase


### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans
Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Possible additional information to include:

* Have you applied for other grants so far?
